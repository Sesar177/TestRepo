# Meshtastic
## What is it
Meshtastic is a wireless network using **low cost** and **low power** devices anyone can use to connect to a full _off-the-network_.
Devices connected to this network can be connected, using their own batteries, not using cell phone infrastructure, now even using wifi networks. They can work as an emergency network when all grids and networks are down.


'''
MeshtasticÂ® is a project that enables you to use inexpensive LoRa radios as a long range off-grid communication platform in areas without existing or reliable communications infrastructure. This project is 100% community driven and open source!
